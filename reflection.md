- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
By using association, we can make more efficient and functional code. We can simplify the design of a complicated system such as a train by breaking it down into manageable parts, which is represented by the different classes that compose the Train class. It also allows for the reuse of code, which saves time while programming and lessens confusion. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Putting all the working parts together was the most difficult part of this assignment. I would advise reviewing the accessor/getter methods and array lists (especially in the association context).
